Medical Credit Fund (MCF) enables health SMEs to access affordable finance in order to improve the quality of healthcare in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>The combined investment of these three development institutions and private sources brings MCF&rsquo;s total capital available for loans to more than USD 40m. MCF will be able to accelerate and increase the scope of its activities, catalyzing healthcare investments and achieving greater impact on healthcare for underserved populations in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>Sara Taylor, Investment Director of the Impact Fund, managed by CDC, said: &lsquo;Too many people across Africa are still unable to access good quality healthcare, which is why we&rsquo;ve invested in MCF&rsquo;s unique model which delivers impact on many levels. First, MCF helps extend affordable access to people who need it, secondly it supports healthcare providers in implementing higher quality standards, and thirdly it engages with financial institutions to increase the overall level of lending to the healthcare sector. We&rsquo;re excited to be supporting a team that has already achieved great results and plans to build on these going forward.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The lack of adequate healthcare facilities poses a significant impediment to the development of human capital across Africa,&rsquo; said Mary-Jean Moyo, IFC Regional Industry Head for Manufacturing, Agribusiness and Services in sub-Saharan Africa. &lsquo;IFC&rsquo;s funding to MCF will support the expansion of an integrated product that not only brings a lasting development impact but also further opens up the healthcare SME lending space, catalyzing the commercial banking industry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Christophe Paquet, Head of the Health and Social Protection Division at AFD: &lsquo;Health system strengthening is a priority for AFD. MCF provides tailored financing for operations and investments, while ensuring a continuous improvement of the quality of care using the SafeCare standards. As a key partner of AFD, we wish to support MCF&rsquo;s expansion into francophone Africa, where profit and non-for profit private health facilities provide care for a large share of the population, including the poorest.&rsquo;</p>

<p>One of the healthcare providers that has already capitalized on this access to credit through MCF is Nyali Children&rsquo;s Hospital in Mombasa, Kenya. Nyali has taken out a USD 2m loan to finance the construction of a 60-bed hospital. &lsquo;A loan this size would never have been possible without MCF, as many financial institutions consider investments in the health sector a big risk,&rsquo; said Nyali director and resident doctor Wanjiru Abuto. &lsquo;We will be the only private hospital of this size in the coastal region offering quality integrated maternal and child care 24/7 and catering to all income groups.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Results so far</strong></p>

<p>MCF&rsquo;s unique risk reduction and risk-sharing model has successfully attracted banks into the healthcare sector. Its 97% historic repayment performance has shown that health SMEs are indeed bankable. So far, MCF and its African partner banks have disbursed more than USD 24m in loans to over 800 healthcare providers. In collaboration with PharmAccess and technical assistance partners, it has developed an extensive training program to improve both business performance and clinical performance, using the internationally accredited SafeCare standards. MCF&rsquo;s integrated approach, which increases the impact of investments considerably, has led to quality improvement at more than 70% of the facilities.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This new support from some of the world&rsquo;s most valued development finance institutions as well as three private investors is another important step in working towards inclusive healthcare, building on the strong foundation established with our existing public and private donors and investors,&rsquo; says MCF Managing Director Arjan Poels. &lsquo;This new financing round will significantly catalyze our efforts to improve access to finance for the private healthcare sector in Africa, and we look forward to accelerating our impact together.&rsquo;</p>

<p><strong>Building on a strong foundation</strong></p>

<p>MCF has been working to provide access to credit for health SMEs since 2010. In 2012, MCF raised USD 10.6m from OPIC and four leading international foundations. This was made possible by, among others, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the G20 SME Finance Challenge and USAID, who provided first loss and technical assistance grants. Today&rsquo;s closing adds to USD 6m in first loss capital as well as the USD 17.45m raised in 2016 from OPIC, Calvert Foundation, a private impact investor and a Dutch Family Office &ndash; an expansion realized thanks to the support of the Dutch Good Growth Fund, Pfizer Foundation and Calvert Foundation, which helped to reduce the investment risk for follow-on investors.</p>

<p>This expansion allows the fund to meet the demand for larger and more flexible loans, while also continuing to cater to the needs of the health SMEs it has been serving since day one. It can now facilitate loans of up to USD 2.5m and finance not only healthcare providers but also other players in the healthcare sector such as medical education institutions or suppliers of medicines and equipment. Finally, the expansion has enabled MCF to enter into new partnerships and explore opportunities in other countries in sub-Saharan Africa.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eudevdays.eu/" target="_blank">European Development Days</a> (EDD), organized by the European Commission, is Europe&rsquo;s leading forum on development. Digitalization played a major role in many of this year&rsquo;s discussions. Andrus Ansip, Vice President for the Digital Single Market in the European Commission, proclaimed that &lsquo;every development project needs to have a digital component.&rsquo;</p>

<h4>Session on digital disruption</h4>

<p>PharmAccess hosted a debate on <a href="https://www.eudevdays.eu/sessions/digital-disruption-development-impact-inclusive-healthcare" target="_blank">digital disruption of development</a>, which provided not only a tour de horizon of the potential of digital, but also concrete examples of how digital innovations are already driving change in the development arena.</p>

<p>The panel consisted of <strong>Hans Docter</strong> (Director for Sustainable Development at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs), <strong>Laura Crow</strong> (Senior Product Manager M-Pesa at the Vodafone Group), <strong>Alec Behrens</strong> (Co-founder of Booking.com and founder of Skillslab.tv and 24surgery.com) and <strong>Maxwell Antwi</strong> (Country Director Ghana at PharmAccess). Alexander Kohnstamm (Director Advocacy at the Joep Lange Institute) moderated the session.</p>

<p>M-Pesa was mentioned repeatedly at EDD as one of those transformational services that the private sector has helped to bring. Recently published research concluded that M-Pesa has led to a 2% poverty reduction across Kenya. Crow emphasized the importance of public-private partnerships. &lsquo;Setting up randomized controlled trials with different groups to demonstrate health impact is very expensive. That&rsquo;s where the private sector needs to work with the development community to have a better and cost-efficient way of measuring impact. Once the evidence is clear in black and white, it becomes an easier choice for governments to come on board.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Speaking from personal experience, Antwi laid out some of the challenges in Ghana. &lsquo;Sixteen years ago I graduated from medical school in a class of 80. Just nine of us are still in Ghana. My country currently has only four radiation oncologists &ndash; but there are ten Ghanaian radiation oncologists in New York City alone!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He also described the crucial role of the private sector and some of the products developed to meet a market need in Ghana, such as a digital proxy means testing tool that identifies poor households who are eligible for a premium waiver in the National Health Insurance Scheme (NHIS). &nbsp;On the supply side of the system, the NHIS often has delays in paying out claims to healthcare providers. This especially hits private providers, as they need liquidity to pay out wages or rent. The Medical Credit Fund has developed a receivable financing product that provides an advance on the NHIS claim, delivering cash to providers who have already delivered care but have yet to be paid.</p>

<p>Docter emphasized that the development community needs more disruption. &lsquo;I believe that as development practitioners, if you care about bringing health to people, about being inclusive, about reaching the poor, you have to embrace new digital technology because it makes cheaper options available where they weren&rsquo;t available before.&rsquo; In his view, the future of healthcare in Africa is private. &lsquo;The money we can mobilize from the public sector, development money or from citizens, is only going to be a fraction of what is needed to develop the health infrastructure that is needed in Africa. You need the drive of the private sector to develop these new technologies and to come up with models and then roll them out at a scale where it becomes relevant.&rsquo; According to Docter, &lsquo;the uptake of technologies that are cheaper and more reliable will be faster in the private sector rather than within a public system where you need to change the whole system nationwide before you can start implementing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Antwi agreed, adding that at the same time it&rsquo;s imperative to keep the public sector informed. &lsquo;Work with the private sector to generate the evidence. But don&rsquo;t forget about advocacy and generating political will, because that&rsquo;s where the limitation often lies. Once the evidence is there, you have to make sure the political economy is ripe enough to be able to take that forward.&rsquo;</p>

<p>After disrupting the travel industry, Alec Behrens has now set his sights on access to surgical care across the world. He is currently setting up an online streaming platform that allows healthcare professionals to view, share and participate in educational video content &ndash; with the aim of building and sharpening surgical skills. He calls it &lsquo;Netflix for surgeons.&rsquo; It can help boost quality of care in high-income countries, but more than that it will address a huge skills and resources gap in LMICs. Behrens emphasized that in the end, it&rsquo;s not just about the technology &ndash; it all starts with demand. &lsquo;If the demand doesn&rsquo;t exist, it&rsquo;s not going to be national, not international, not disruptive, nothing &ndash; because there&rsquo;s no demand.&rsquo;</p>

<h4>Session on the private sector</h4>

<p>The following morning, PharmAccess participated in a session organized by Global Fund and the Stop AIDS Alliance on <a href="https://www.eudevdays.eu/sessions/harnessing-power-private-sector-achieve-health-sdg" target="_blank">harnessing the power of the private sector to achieve the health SDG</a>, and the role of public-private partnerships in ending&nbsp;AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria.</p>

<p>The panel consisted of&nbsp;<strong>Susan Mboya</strong> (President of The Coca-Cola Africa Foundation), <strong>Louise Van Deth</strong> (Executive Director of Aidsfonds), <strong>Hans Docter</strong> (Director for Sustainable Development at the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs) and <strong>Ewout Irrgang</strong> (Director Advisory Services at PharmAccess). It was moderated by <strong>Christoph Benn</strong> (Director of External Relations at the Global Fund).</p>

<h4>European Development Days</h4>

<p>Every year, EDD brings the development community together to share ideas and experiences in ways that inspire new partnerships and innovative solutions to the world&rsquo;s most pressing challenges.</p>

<p>This year, the dwindling US leadership in the global development landscape, the need for broader alliances and how Europe can try to fill this gap permeated many of the debates at the conference. High-level speakers included the new head of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, European Commissioner for International Cooperation and Development Neven Mimica, and several heads of state, including the president of Ghana, Nana Akufo-Addo.</p>

<p>In his speech during the opening of the conference, Afuko-Addo highlighted the importance of focusing on youth, digitalization and the private sector. &lsquo;Whilst we empower the private sector to create jobs and wealth, my government, recognizing the benefits of the digital revolution, has instituted measures to keep the youth in touch with global trends, and also equip them with the skills, which, together with their sense of enterprise and innovation, will be necessary in Ghana&rsquo;s economic transformation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>EDD was also the stage for the signing of the new <a href="http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-1503_en.htm" target="_blank">European Consensus on Development</a>, a collective vision and plan of action to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable development.</p>

<div class="content">
<p>Yesterday, Dan Ariely gave a Talk in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.debalie.nl/agenda/podium/dan-ariely-on-social-innovations-for-health/e_9782956/p_11769299/" target="_blank">de Balie</a>&nbsp;in Amsterdam on behalf of our partner the Joep Lange Institute on social innovation and behavior to democratize health in Africa. Nowadays big companies are not the only ones to leverage mobile technologies and big data. The audience learned that digital disruption, through products like the M-TIBA mobile health wallet, can be used to pursue social equity and revolutionize healthcare in resource poor settings.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Most of the digital technology that is being developed helps people to spend more rather than think better and save more. Think of Apple Pay and Android pay and so on. Because of that, we need to very carefully think about what we want technology to do. How do we use digital technology to develop the right kind of tools that will help us think better and behave better?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Professor Dan Ariely is one of the world&rsquo;s leading experts on irrational behavior and behavioral economics, and the first Academic Chair of the Joep Lange Institute. Professor Ariely and his team at the Center for Advanced Hindsight at Duke University were brought on board by the Joep Lange Institute to help make the M-TIBA health wallet more effective by discovering ways to encourage users to save for healthcare.</p>

<p>Ariely&rsquo;s talk at De Balie focused on how predictably irrational we are how we think about and spend our money. &nbsp;He stressed that money and health are intertwined and therefore need to be thought about together. By personalizing the examples, he asked attendees to focus on the economic concept of opportunity cost: forgoing something of value to acquire something else. For example: How many lattes do I need to give up to afford these new earbuds? Or, in the case of the very the impoverished, how much less food can I buy for my family to afford this doctors visit? Ariely: &ldquo;Caring about the future and saving is difficult for everybody, not just the poor, of course for them it is extra difficult. M-TIBA, electronic wallets or the coin experiment, all of them are attempts to tools for better thinking.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Before Ariely took the stage, Onno Schellekens, Managing Director of PharmAccess Group, described their joint undertaking as &ldquo;Bringing healthcare and solidarity to the people who need it most through digital technology.&rdquo; Ultimately it appears as though inclusive healthcare is indeed possible, but achieving it will depend on political will and breaking the status quo. Enabling peer-to-peer donations and a new form of healthcare solidarity, using M-TIBA, is one important step in this direction.</p>

<p>M-TIBA, develop by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pharmaccess.org/" target="_blank">PharmAccess</a>&nbsp;with support from the Dutch government is a mobile health wallet that allows people to send, save and receive digital money and entitlements that can only be used for health &ndash; directly on their phone. M-TIBA recently won the Financial Times/IFC Transformational Business Award.</p>

<p>Not only does the mobile health wallet encourage people to save, but it disrupts the notion that poor people cannot save and that effective healthcare financing is not possible for the poor. Ariely asks, &ldquo;How can we get deeply embedded into people&rsquo;s lives to help them save more?&rdquo; It turns it&rsquo;s about changing the small details of people&rsquo;s live and making a place for it in the home. He went on to explain that a core part of this kind of behavior change is to become part of people&rsquo;s daily lives &ndash; to overcome the difference between remembering and acting. Becoming part of people&rsquo;s daily lives on this scale has now for the first time become possible through the widespread usage of the mobile phone.</p>

<p><strong>Premier of The Great Escape</strong><br />
Another important aspect of the evening was the premier of the documentary The Great Escape, which refers to the great escape from poverty. It is a tribute to Joep Lange&rsquo;s dream: to leverage digital tech to improve healthcare, particularly for the world&rsquo;s poorest. This moving documentary focuses on the lives and words of two protagonists: Dr. Khamo Rogo, a professor, gynecologist, and head of the World Bank Group&rsquo;s Health in Africa Initiative, and a young Kenyan woman named Gladys Akinyi, a single mother in the slums, who struggles to survive each day.</p>

<p>Rogo lays out the case for disruptive thinking and how it is solving some of the health challenges of people like Gladys. He describes cellphones as one of the biggest social equalizers in Sub-Saharan Africa, because it for the first time gives identities to individuals, it helps locate them and gives you a record of what these individuals do. The cell phone has enabled Africa to leapfrog technologically, with the continent now leading the world in mobile phones.</p>

<p>The evening concluded with a short panel discussion where Njide Ndili, PharmAccess&rsquo; country director Nigeria and Marc Wesselink, Serial Entrepreneur, Director&nbsp;<a href="https://www.startupbootcamp.org/accelerator/fintech-cybersecurity-amsterdam/" target="_blank">StartupBootcamp</a>, joined Dr. Ariely and moderator Tracy Metz onstage. Referring to M-TIBA, Marc Wesselink said &ldquo;the best ideas now come from Africa, but it lacks execution. That is where we can help.&rdquo;</p>
